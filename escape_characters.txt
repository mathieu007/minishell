- `"` (double quote): to include a literal `"` character inside a double-quoted string
- `\` (backslash): to include a literal `\` character inside a double-quoted string
- `$` (dollar sign): to include a literal `$` character inside a double-quoted string without triggering variable expansion
- ``` (backtick): to include a literal ``` character inside a double-quoted string
- newline: to include a newline character inside a double-quoted string
- tab: to include a tab character inside a double-quoted string
- vertical tab: to include a vertical tab character inside a double-quoted string
- carriage return: to include a carriage return character inside a double-quoted string
- form feed: to include a form feed character inside a double-quoted string
- hex digits: to include a character specified by its hexadecimal value, in the form `\xhh`

For example, the command `echo "Hello, \"world\"!"` would output `Hello, "world"!`. The backslash before the `"` character escaped it, allowing it to be included as a literal within the double-quoted string.

Similarly, the command `echo "First line.\nSecond line."` would output:

```
First line.
Second line.
```

The `\n` sequence is interpreted as a newline character, which causes the output to be split onto two lines.
